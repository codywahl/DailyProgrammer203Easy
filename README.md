#/r/DailyProgrammer #203 [Easy]
This repo kicks off my collection of solutions to reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/ 's daily programmming challenges. 

This project is for challenge #203 [Easy]. 
View the challenge here: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ww3pl/2015223_challenge_203_easy_the_start_of_something/

My Notes: I decided to take this first challenge a little more literally than intended, as the challenge itself was very simple. Since the challenge stated that "The square may be of any size and of any colour." I gave the square that exact ability, to be "any size of any color." Clicking the square will randomly resize and re-color the square.

Description:

All great things start with something small. Sometimes people don't even realise what goes into making a 'small' thing.
A popular story is linked above about a group of graphics programmers who create a rendering engine in some amount of time. After some time HR came to see what the programmers had accomplished. They responded by showing a black triangle on a tv.
HR was less than impressed (understandle for a non techie) but it goes to show the natural evolution of a program. What they didn't realise is that the programmers have created their base engine and can now easily add and extend on top of it.
Maybe you can follow similar steps?

Challenge:

On your screen, display a square.
You may use any libraries available to you.
The square may be of any size and of any colour.
